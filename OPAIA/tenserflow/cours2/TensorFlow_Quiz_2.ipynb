    "\n",
    "### Question 1: What does the `Dense` layer do in a neural network?\n",
    "   - a) Adds dropout regularization to the network.\n",
    "   - b) Adds a fully connected layer where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.\n",
    "   - c) Implements convolutional operations.\n",
    "   - d) Applies pooling operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Why is the `relu` activation function used in the hidden layers?\n",
    "   - a) To prevent negative outputs.\n",
    "   - b) To introduce non-linearity and help with the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "   - c) To ensure outputs are between 0 and 1.\n",
    "   - d) To apply a linear transformation to the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: What is the purpose of `model.compile` in the code?\n",
    "   - a) To define the structure of the neural network.\n",
    "   - b) To configure the model for training by specifying the optimizer and loss function.\n",
    "   - c) To initialize the weights of the neural network.\n",
    "   - d) To load pre-trained weights into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Which optimizer is used in the code, and why might it be chosen?\n",
    "   - a) SGD, because it is simple and easy to implement.\n",
    "   - b) Adam, because it adapts the learning rate and converges faster.\n",
    "   - c) RMSprop, because it is effective for recurrent neural networks.\n",
    "   - d) Adagrad, because it adjusts the learning rate based on the frequency of parameter updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: What does the `model.fit` function do?\n",
    "   - a) Evaluates the model on the training data.\n",
    "   - b) Trains the model using the provided training data.\n",
    "   - c) Compiles the model for training.\n",
    "   - d) Saves the trained model to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6: Why are angles converted to radians in the code?\n",
    "   - a) Because the `np.radians` function requires angles in radians.\n",
    "   - b) Because trigonometric functions in NumPy expect angles in radians.\n",
    "   - c) Because radians are the standard unit for all measurements.\n",
    "   - d) Because it simplifies the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7: What does the `verbose=0` parameter in `model.fit` do?\n",
    "   - a) Enables detailed logging of the training process.\n",
    "   - b) Disables logging output during the training process.\n",
    "   - c) Saves the training logs to a file.\n",
    "   - d) Shows only the final training loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 8: What is the purpose of `plt.axis('off')` in the plotting section?\n",
    "   - a) To enable grid lines on the plot.\n",
    "   - b) To remove the axes for a cleaner visualization.\n",
    "   - c) To set the axis limits.\n",
    "   - d) To display the plot in 3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 9: What is the shape of the input data for the neural network?\n",
    "   - a) A 2D array with one row per sample and one column per feature.\n",
    "   - b) A 3D array with one dimension for time.\n",
    "   - c) A 4D array for images.\n",
    "   - d) A 1D array with the shape determined by `input_shape' = [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "# Réponse\n",
    "a\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 10: What is the primary purpose of the `mean_squared_error` loss function in this context?\n",
    "    - a) To classify the input data into different categories.\n",
    "    - b) To measure the difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "    - c) To normalize the input data.\n",
    "    - d) To apply a regularization term to the loss.\n",
